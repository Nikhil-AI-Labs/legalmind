## 🔍 Verify Deployment

### Backend Test
```bash
# Test the endpoint is working
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_TOKEN" \
  https://your-backend-url/api/v1/documents

# Should return:
# {"documents": [...all your docs...]}
```

## ⚠️ Common Issues & Fixes

### "Documents not loading"
- Check: Backend is deployed and running
- Check: Authentication token is valid
- Check: Supabase table has data with user_id

### "Import errors in chat"
- Check: `checkDocumentExists` added to imports in Chat.tsx
- Check: Function exported from legalBackend.ts
- Solution: Verify line 28 of legalBackend.ts has `export`

### "401 Unauthorized errors"
- Check: Auth token being sent in headers
- Check: Backend receives Authorization header
- Solution: Restart frontend to refresh token

### "Documents still show after delete"
- Check: Browser cache cleared
- Solution: Hard refresh (Ctrl+Shift+R)
- Check: Backend restarted

## 📊 Expected Results After Deploy

| Scenario | Result |
|----------|--------|
| Upload doc, refresh | ✅ Document persists |
| Sign out, sign in | ✅ Documents reload |
| Delete in Supabase, refresh | ✅ Document disappears |
| Open deleted doc URL | ✅ Error + redirect |
| User A uploads, User B signs in | ✅ User B sees empty list |

---

## 🎯 Success Criteria

Your deployment is successful when:

✅ Documents load on `/documents` page  
✅ Same documents visible after refresh  
✅ Same documents visible after sign out/in  
✅ Deleted documents disappear from dashboard  
✅ Error message shows for deleted docs  
✅ Chat history still loads when opening doc  
✅ Multiple users see only their own docs

## 📞 Troubleshooting

If something doesn't work:

1. **Check logs**
   - Backend: Look for print statements (❌ errors)
   - Frontend: Open browser DevTools Console

2. **Test backend directly**
   - Open Postman or curl
   - Test `/api/v1/documents` endpoint
   - Verify Supabase table has data

3. **Clear cache**
   - Browser: Ctrl+Shift+Delete
   - Frontend: Restart dev server
   - Backend: Restart Python process

4. **Verify Supabase**
   - Check documents table exists
   - Check documents table has user_id column
   - Check documents table has data
